🕵️‍♂️ SQL Investigation Project — Fake E-commerce Data
This is a SQL-based investigation project using fake e-commerce data for learning purposes. The dataset includes fictional customer details, orders, and product records to simulate real-world business analytics. I practiced SQL operations such as JOINs, GROUP BY, filtering, sorting, and subqueries to derive insights like total sales, customer purchase patterns, and popular products.

⚠️ Note: All data is completely made up and intended strictly for educational and portfolio use.
